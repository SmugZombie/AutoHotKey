Purpose:
Quick access to servers for testing of responsiveness or general access purposes

Usage:
Once you open the application it will stay live until you choose Quit from either the context menu or tray. Its pretty self explanitory as you can simply enter a host (user and pass if applicable), choose your protocol, and click Connect launching the application required and resetting the gui. You can also throw host names into it automatcially with the key combo Ctrl-Shft-S using the contents of your clipboard. Always On Top is enabled by defualt but can be switched off via the Right Click context menu.
